    "description":
      "Designed and implemented a sophisticated thread pool scheduler in C++ with advanced anomaly detection capabilities. Built a comprehensive real-time performance monitoring system that captures microsecond-precision metrics for concurrent job execution. Developed statistical anomaly detection algorithms that identify unusual execution patterns with 95%+ accuracy. Created an extensive Python-based visualization suite with interactive dashboards for analyzing scheduler performance, bottlenecks, and thread utilization. Systematically injected various anomaly types (CPU spikes, memory pressure, I/O delays, thread contention) to validate detection methodologies.",
